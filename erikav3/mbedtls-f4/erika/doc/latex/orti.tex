When configuring the sytstem, RT-\/\+Druid generates an ORTI file. The ORTI file is a text file containing information for debuggers related to the OS objects that are statically configured in the system.

The presence of an ORTI file simplifies kernel-\/aware debugging in advanced debugging systems such as Lauterbach TRACE32 and i\+System Win\+Idea.

The generated ORTI follows the original OSEK/\+VDX ORTI specification for single core configurations, and follows the ORTI SMP extensions defined by Lauterbach and i\+System for multi core configurations.
