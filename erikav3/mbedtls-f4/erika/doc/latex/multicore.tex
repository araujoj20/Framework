In particular\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Scheduling is partitioned on each core.
\item Each application task is statically partitioned on a given core.
\item Each counter is statically partitioned on a given core; Alarms and Schedule Table are handled on the same core of the counter they are assigned to.
\item Startup and Shutdown are done in a coordinated way using barriers, as specified by the AUTOSAR OS standard.
