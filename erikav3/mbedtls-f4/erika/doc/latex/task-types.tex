ERIKA3 supports two flavors of tasks\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Basic Tasks}. A basic task is the simplest task in ERIKA3, providing concurrency together with a one-\/shot task model. Basic Tasks can share their stack to reduce the overall RAM usage.
\item {\itshape Extended Tasks}. An extended task is a task that can block on the synchronization primitive \doxylink{group__primitives-event_ga01ccee0d30cdc7288a518351244b16b7}{Wait\+Event()}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Basic Tasks are typically implemented as normal C functions, that executes their code and then ends. One of these executions is called also {\itshape Task Instance}. After the end of a basic task, its stack is freed. Basic Tasks never block, and they are the ideal kind of tasks for implementing stack sharing techniques.

Extended Tasks, on the converse, are typically implemented as a never ending task in which each instance ends with a synchronization implemented with a call to the \doxylink{group__primitives-event_ga01ccee0d30cdc7288a518351244b16b7}{Wait\+Event()} primitive. Extended tasks always have a private stack.

RT-\/\+Druid identifies a task as Extended when its OIL definition contains the specification of {\itshape Events}. A task without any {\itshape Event} assigned is a Basic Task.

About (periodic) execution of tasks in OSEK/\+VDX and AUTOSAR OS, we can say that\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Basic tasks can execute when they are activated using \doxylink{group__primitives-task_gacd33f94ca57ea3776a0bf73b4ec6963c}{Activate\+Task()} or \doxylink{group__primitives-task_gaa219f309dc9471326804fda45f2fe449}{Chain\+Task()}. A basic task, in some configuration, can remember pending activations.
\item Extended tasks are activated once (typically at system startup using the AUTOSTART feature), and typically wait for the arrival of one or more events (typically inside a forever loop).
\item {\itshape Periodic execution} of a task can be obtained in various ways\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item using a periodic interrupt (which in turns either activates a basic task or sets an event on an extended task);
\item using a periodic Alarm, whose notification is either the activation of a basic task or the setting of an event on an extended task;
\item using a Schedule Table, to implement a similar pattern of an Alarm notification.
\item Note that it is not forbidden to Activate a basic task or to set an event on an Extended task in addition to a periodic alarm / schedule table. To that respect, activation and periodicity are two orthogonal concepts in OSEK/\+VDX and AUTOSAR OS.
